WebRTC P2P Web App for Chat, Audio/Video Calls and File Sharing

This Web App will use WebRTC protocols to connect Peer Clients, and will also use WebTorrent Protocols to transfer files. 
In the future, major builds will include wifi-direct for android devices, and possibly UDP and TCP for desktop devices(this will be a node gui app).
